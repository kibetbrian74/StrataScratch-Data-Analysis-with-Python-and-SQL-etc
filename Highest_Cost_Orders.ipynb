The approach involves filtering the data by date, calculating daily totals per customer, finding the maximums for each day, and merging results with customer info.\n",

        "- `orders`: Contains order records with columns like cust_id, order_date, and total_order_cost.\n",

        "\n",

        "- Output their first name, date, and maximum cost for that day."
