The code uses the pandas to manipulate and analyze data.\n",

        "The code snippet assumes the presence of two dataframes: `db_employee` and `db_dept`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`db_employee`** contains information about employees, including columns `department_id` and `salary`.\n",

        "### **The Problem**\n",
        "The objective was to calculate the difference between the highest salaries in the marketing and engineering departments. The code snippet performs the following steps to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Merges `db_employee` and `db_dept` dataframes using the `pd.merge()` function. The merge is performed using a left join, with `department_id` from `db_employee` matching `id` from `db_dept`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Filters the merged dataframe (`df`) to create a new dataframe (`df1`) containing only rows where the department is engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Groups `df1` by `department` and calculates the `maximum salary` using the `groupby()` and `max()` methods. The result is stored in a new dataframe, which has columns department and eng_salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Filters the merged dataframe (`df`) to create a new dataframe (`df2`) containing only rows where the department is marketing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Groups `df2` by department and calculates the maximum salary. The result is stored in a new dataframe, which has columns `department` and `mkt_salary`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calculates the absolute difference between the `mkt_salary` and `eng_salary` columns of `df_mkt` and `df_eng` respectively. The result is stored in a new dataframe, which has a single column `salary_difference`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Renames the `salary_difference` column to `'salary_difference'` using the columns attribute of the result dataframe."
