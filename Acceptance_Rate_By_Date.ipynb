        "This solution involves analyzing friend request data to calculate the overall friend acceptance rate by date. The code uses the pandas library to merge and analyze two dataframes, calculate the acceptance rate, and create a new dataframe with the date and corresponding acceptance rate. The final result is a dataframe sorted by date with the acceptance rate.\n",

The `df_accepted` dataframe contains friend requests with the action labeled as `'accepted'`. Each dataframe has columns `user_id_sender`, `user_id_receiver`, and `date`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Problem**\n",
        "The goal is to calculate the overall friend acceptance rate by date. To do this, we need to merge the `df_sent` and `df_accepted` dataframes using the user IDs as the merge keys. Then, we group the merged dataframe by the date, count the number of accepted actions per date, and calculate the acceptance rate. Finally, we create a new dataframe with the `date` and `acceptance rate`, sorted by `date`."
